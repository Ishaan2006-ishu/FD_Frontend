each object linked to protype

Prototypal inheritence:-

The prototype contains method that are accessible to all object linked to protype .
this is different from normal inheritence as child class was inheriting from parent class and this is like an 
instace inheriting from a class.

Ex-constructur function , Es6 classes etc.
